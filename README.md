Lego-Mindstorms-ATM
===========================

A classic ATM with a fully integrated security system. 3 of my Mechatronics Engineering classmates and I worked together on this project. Together, we designed, built, developed and presented our very own ATM made out of a Lego Mindstorms NXT 2.0. We developed the embedded code in RobotC.
