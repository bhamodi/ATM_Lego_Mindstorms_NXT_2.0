# Lego-Mindstorms-ATM

This repository features the code behind a fully-functional ATM including an integrated security system. Alongside three of my Mechatronics Engineering colleagues - we designed, built, developed and presented our very own ATM controlled by a Lego Mindstorms NXT 2.0 microcontroller. The source code is written in RobotC, which is just a variation of C.
